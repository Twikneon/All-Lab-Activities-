	<h1>The Info of a Lost Guy</h1>
	<p>He is an honorable person of our society. He reallu used to talk about a lot of innovative and motivational thoughts. The cant really be pictorized as a bad person. The family is very sad to lose him form last 5 days. He never had a lot of enemies to say that he may have been kidnapped but a good person cant always be liked by everyone as well. well the description may not always be true as well.A good guy is empathetic and forgiving. He challenges himself to be a better man: most men are raised to believe they need to fight and conquer. A good guy understands to overcome one's own self is better than competing and beating anyone else. He's committed and faithful: he says what he means, and means what he says</p>
	<h3>His History</h3>
	<p>Physical characteristics such as skin and eye colour, hair type and colour and body shape are determined by genetics, but can also be influenced by the environment. Over long periods of time, the environment will act on the genes to develop particular characteristics within a population.Aside from the annual celebration—a deeply anti-Catholic holiday that recalls Fawkes' failure through fireworks, burning barrels, and effigies of Fawkes and the Pope set flame—Guy Fawkes' legacy has carried on in at least one other important way. (And no we don't mean V for Vendetta or Anonymous' co-opted masks.) The very word “guy” and the plural, somewhat gender-neutral word “guys” derives from Fawkes himself, says the Washington Post.</p>

	<h1>What We Say</h1>
	<p>Thoughts of A Man is a book of knowledge that feeds the soul to enhance spiritual, mental, physical and financial growth and when applied, it is knowledge that will keep the soul from starving. Thoughts of A Man is knowledge that will teach, test and transform you in all areas of your life. “Every thought-seed sown or allowed to fall into the mind, and to take root there, produces its own, blossoming sooner or later into act, and bearing its own fruitage of opportunity and circumstance. Good thoughts bear good fruit, bad thoughts bad fruit.“
“Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits; thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own husbandry.”
“As the reaper of his own harvest, man learns both by suffering and bliss.”
“By pursuing this process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the master gardener of his soul, the director of his life.”</p>

	<h2>What We Expect</h2>
	<p>Every family has a different expectation of “normal” behavior. When I as a kid, I used to love to go over to other people's houses for dinner because every house was so different. At Rowena's house, we said grace before we ate. At Alison's house, we had to clean up—really well—after we ate. At Tilly's house, we ate chicken with gravy, homemade pie, and occasionally had a food fight. At Milo's house, her parents had wine with dinner (and she thought it was odd that at my house we drank water and ate mung-bean-and-brown-rice casseroles and huge bowls of green salad).

All the rules were different, too. My parents liked a quiet house, and the radio was usually on low playing classical music. At Tilly's house we could watch TV, at my house we didn't have one. And so it went. The rules and customs you establish for your household and family may be completely different from what's happening at the Joneses down the block. There's no one “normal,” but it's helpful to have your family's “normal” explicitly defined so your child understands the behavior expectations.</p>

	<h1>Good deeds</h1>
	<p>Plant a tree. Think of something you do well, and use your talent to benefit others – for example performing magic tricks at a children's hospital or playing music at a nursing home. Teach an elderly person to use a computer to surf the Internet or write e-mails. Organize a family meal and appreciate being together. Doing a good deed helps you focus your thoughts outward toward others. It helps you take a step outside your own world for a little while. Performing good deeds can have positive effects on your health, like reducing stress.</p>

	<h2>HE would never go to......</h2>
	<p>As you know that today many people travel different cities and the most of the visitors visit the capital cities because sightseeing places prevail than other cities of country. The museums, theaters, art galleries, shops, monuments, mosques and churches generally take place in the capital cities. In cities you will come with contact different cultures, peoples, different meals or foods. It will be easier to you if you know the culture of the country and you can easily be familiar with them. Visiting the historical places, museums, theaters, art galleries of the city give us information about the history of country or city. Entertainment, festivals, adventure, cuisine, education, health and business enhance our experience while travelling. People take the camera to take the picture of every interesting thing they see while traveling and they enjoy sharing photos with their relatives.

Although traveling is good for relaxing and clearing your mind and I think that visiting the wilderness areas are the best places for this. Because people who work hard during the year they are getting tried and more stressful, lose their energy and going to mountains, lakes, seas, valleys, plains, waterfalls, forests: different kinds of trees, flowers and plants; animals and birds give the positive energy and make us get of our stressful life. Listening the river flows sound, birds singing, flowers beauty, some interesting animals feels us cheerfully and much more convenient.</p>

	<h1>Description of his Looks</h1>
	<p>Physical characteristics are defining traits or features about your body. These are aspects that are visually apparent, knowing nothing else about the person. The first thing you see when you look at someone could be their hair, clothes, nose, or figure. These are all examples of physical characteristics. Physical characteristics such as skin and eye colour, hair type and colour and body shape are determined by genetics, but can also be influenced by the environment. Over long periods of time, the environment will act on the genes to develop particular characteristics within a population.</p>

	<h2>Dont panic even.....</h2>
	<p>Over the past few decades, neuroscientists have shed new light on how chronic stress can make the brain more susceptible to mental health disorders. Many of those studies have looked at the long-term effects of adverse childhood events (ACES) or living through traumatic events like the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 or Hurricane Katrina (See Childhood Trauma Leaves Lasting Marks on the Brain). The majority have shown that some people display more resilience in the face of these sorts of challenges (See The Resilient Brain) – and that resilience is an active neurobiological process that can protect the brain despite increased and prolonged environmental stressors. Now, as people worldwide struggle to adapt to school and work closures, as well as other significant lifestyle changes, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our favorite public figures are telling us not to “panic.”

Nestler portraitHere, Eric J. Nestler, M.D., Ph.D., Nash Family Professor of Neuroscience and Director of the Friedman Brain Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and a member of the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives (DABI), discusses how stress affects the brain – and how we can train ourselves to be more resilient whether we are facing a pandemic or any other disastrous situation.</p>

	<p>. Firstly ascertain whether the requesting party has the authority to request a COD.. This
authority could vary based on the type of bill of lading issued and at what stage of
negotiation the bill of lading is.. For example :
If the bill of lading issued is a Straight Bill of Lading and the shipper is still legally
in possession of the bills of lading, only the shipper can request the shipping line
for the COD..
If the bill of lading issued is an Order Bill of Lading consigned To Order of
Shipper, but the bill of lading has already been endorsed by the shipper to the
consignee, then only the consignee can request the shipping line for the COD..
2. The COD request should be received before the container reaches the destination and
the manifest has been filed with customs.. In a lot of countries, Customs don't allow for a
change of destination once the container has been landed..
3. If the COD is acceptable to the shipping line and customs, then a Manifest Corrector
must be actioned by the lines agent requesting this COD, changing the destination and
a copy of this manifest corrector must be sent to the discharge port agent (new and old)
and also submitted to Customs..
4. It is very important that the manifest be amended, failing which the container might be
delivered to the wrong destination attracting additional costs for the defaulting party..</p>
